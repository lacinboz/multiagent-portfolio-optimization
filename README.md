# Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Portfolio Risk Optimization

This project implements a hybrid portfolio optimization system that combines 
numerical finance methods with a structured multi-agent LLM architecture. 
The framework computes daily returns, covariance matrices, efficient frontier 
points, and optimal portfolio weights under constraints, while LLM agents 
provide explanations, interpretations, and step-by-step analytical reasoning.

The final output is an **interactive portfolio optimization dashboard** where 
users can select asset universes, adjust constraints, visualize risk–return 
trade-offs, and read LLM-generated insights about portfolio behavior.

##  Features

### **Numerical Finance Engine**
- Compute daily returns from historical price data  
- Estimate risk metrics (volatility, covariance, Sharpe ratio)  
- Generate efficient frontier points  
- Solve constrained mean–variance optimization problems  
- Visualize optimized portfolio allocations  

### **Multi-Agent LLM System**
- **Data Agent:** describes and validates input data  
- **Risk Agent:** interprets risk metrics and identifies patterns  
- **Allocation Agent:** compares portfolio options and trade-offs  
- **Supervisor Agent:** coordinates reasoning steps for consistency  
- Structured reasoning pipeline instead of a single monolithic prompt  

### **Interactive Dashboard**
- Adjustable asset universe  
- Risk and allocation constraint controls  
- Efficient frontier plot  
- Optimal portfolio visualization  
- Explanations generated by LLM agents

This repository accompanies the thesis project of Laçin Boz, focusing on the integration of classical portfolio optimization techniques with LLM-based analytical reasoning through a multi-agent architecture.
